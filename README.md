# About Mill Table
The aim of this project is to design a 6 -8 person table (our prototype will be installed in our meeting room) out of standard plywood sheets, one thickness (18mm), and workable by any standard 3 axis cnc machine. The goal is to produce one file everyone could cut his own table with or use it as a base to start his own iteration of the design.

There will be two main instances of this table, the first one will have a cutting mat fitted as the last layer of the table top, a second one, simpler will be frameless and will sport a plywood clean table top surface.

The standard size will be 90 x 220 cm (35.4 x 86.6 inches)

# Open Source Design - Fabrication 
All of GIB's projects are open-source. That is, during the development of any one project, all the content is hosted publicly on Github. We are also available via chat rooms on [Discord](https://discord.gg/3Qf9EzJqV9).
