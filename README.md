# About Mill Table
The aim of this project is to design a 6 -8 person table (our prototype will be installed in our meeting room) out of standard plywood birch sheets, one thickness (18mm), and workable by any standard 3 axis cnc machine. The goal is to produce one file everyone could cut his own table with or use it as a base to start his own iteration of the design. 

The standard size will be 90 x 220 cm (35.4 x 86.6 inches)

Since the original idea sprung from the necessity to design a custom table from our meeting room, our first prototype will include a self-healing mat (the green finish you can see in the pictures) as a top finish layer. As we understand that the general public won't need such a peculiar top, we plan to release a frameless all-plywood version and a customizable one in order to let you finish and enrich the table with the top material of your choosing and they will be available as forks starting after V.0.7. 

# Open Source Design - Fabrication 
We work on experimental design fueled by public support.
We strongly believe in a new way of doing Architecture, one in which we share with you the process and the results of our research, designs and builds.
All of GIB's projects are open-source. That is, during the development of any one project, all the content is hosted publicly on Github. We are also available via chat rooms on [Discord](https://discord.gg/3Qf9EzJqV9).

As we're mostly self-sustained, in order to keep our research free and running, we're on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/StudioGIB) too, where you can support us with your contribute.

# Ethos
The idea behind open sourced furniture is that anyone could take the "recipe" and build it locally.
It cutting down the costs of transport, packaging and delivery, reducing considerably the carbon footprint of the process.
In addition to ecological reasons, to build locally means redirecting work toward local craftsmans, thus an healtier economy.
Choice of wood:
Plywood (birch) is already a pretty good material, ecologically-wise, but we suggest buying FSC plywood (sourced on sustainably managed forests).


# Roadmap
V.0.6 - MArch 2022 - Build a prototype, write the assembly manual

V.0.7 - March 2022 -  refine the joints - publish first frameless fork

V.0.8 - April 2022 - refine the fabrication in order to make it cheaper 

v.0.9 - May 2022 - last tests

V.1.0 - June / July - official release
